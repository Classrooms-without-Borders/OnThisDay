But how viruses move from person to person in smaller, rural communities is less well understood, resulting in public health and economic decisions that are made on the basis of scant information and overgeneralized modeling. The Delineo project is developing a distributed programming environment to run the model over large numbers of computers to scale up the areas that can be accurately modeled.";
